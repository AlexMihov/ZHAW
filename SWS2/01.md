#Lecture 1: Intro to System Security

####Goals
* Good idea what it means to secure an information system
* Knowing an example of a best practice guide of important security controls to secure information systems and understand it's role and level of detail

####Information system
* organized system for the collection, organization and communication of information
* also people, processes, stuff written on paper,
* things that coordinate the people which interact with the system / information
* includes hardware and software that are used to collect, filter, process and create data


####Fundamental Questions in securing Information Systems
* How can we manage information security
* how can we measure weather or not it is secure

####Managing the security (ISO 27000)
ISMS: information security management system
* includes  people, processes and IT systems by applying a risk management process
* the risk is managed and kept at an acceptable level by implementing security controls
* But there is no _TECHNICAL_ information on how to solve the problems

#####Security Controls
* Safeguards or countermeasures to avoid, counteract, detect or minimize security risks
* how to reduce the risk of damage or loss by stopping, deterring or slowing attack against an asset
	* preventive controls (Authentication, firewall)
	* detective controls (alarm, intrusion detection)
	* corrective controls (backup system, redundant systems)

#####Examples (2 out of 114 policies)
* Key management: "A policy on the use, protection and lifetime of cryptographic keys should be developed and implemented trough their whole lifetime"
* Secure disposal or re.use of equipment: "All items of equipment containing storage media should be verified to ensure that any sensitive data and licensed software has been removed or securely overwritten prior to disposal or re-use"

Although it's kinda "common sense" it's still very helpful. This can be used as a checklist so that nothing is being forgotten. It also helps to have a common understanding / terminology for talking and discussing about it.

#####ISO27002
* provides implementation guidance (apparently not really the thing we need)
* shows how a control should look like and what needs to be considered when you design overwritten
* it's again somewhat of a checklist and it should guide you to implement one component in more detail
* tells in details what exactly the control should do, but doesn't show actual solutions
	* "establishing a formal policy prohibiting the use of unauthorized software"
	* "implementing controls that prevent or detect the use of unauthorized software (e.g. application whitelisting")
	* "implement controls that prevent or detect the use if known or suspected malicious websites (e.g. blacklisting)"

#####Summary of ISMS
* very useful as a checklist
* provides a big picture of what controls are necessary to secure a system
* implementing ISMS is kinda hard and takes a lot of effort and time
* needed for certification it's one of the available standards
* but there is no real guidance of a technical point of view
* they don't tell you where to start off, you have no clue which one is the most critical
	* a possible solution is to use the CIS (Critical Security Controls)
	* they show which are _critical_ to have

####CIS Critical Security Controls
20 controls that are _critical_ and need to be implemented.

We will only have a look at the TOP4 because there is some data that tells that those are the most important ones (prevent 85% of all threats).

They also provide some guidance and a prioritization

#####Which controls should be implemented first?
* usually it's the best to implement the ones that are the easies to implement (low hanging fruit)
* if you want a lot of protection, then you start with the first ones

-> there is not a "best" solution

#####TOP4 CIS (rest is in appendix)

(1) Inventory of authorized and unauthorized devices
* only authorized devices get access
* unauthorized ones are prevented from entering
* there are quite a lot of components that are needed
	* Active device discovery component
		* used to find hidden stuff that is leaving traces
		* actively asks every component and checks the answer
	* Passive device discovery component
		* able to find devices that don't react to request
	* Asset inventory Database
		* place where you keep the information about who can do what
	* Network Level Authentication (NLA)
		* you need to authenticate with the service
		* afterwards your network port gets unlocked and grants you access to other component
	* Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)
		* needed for certificates
		* not easy and takes a long time
	* Analytics system
		* Alerting
		* Reporting
		* uses the information gathered from the Discovery to make analysis (synchronizes information and let's you know what is happening in your system)

* As it can be seen it's very difficult to implement even the first Control so most companies won't be able to implement it fully

(2) Inventory of authorized and unauthorized Software
Very similar to the point 1.

* Software whitelisting
* Software Inventory terminology
* Asset inventory Database
* enforcing on the system that programs can't be run that are not whitelisted
* Analytics System

-> only after those points it's very hard to do anything malicious. The only thing that can be done is that a process can be high-jacked but then the attacker has only the rights that the process has (there are solutions for checking if a process is compromised or not, but usually not used)

(3) Secure Configurations for HW&SW on mobile Devices, Laptops, Workstations and Servers


* Baseline Image of operating system that is securely configured

* Integrity checking for the baseline (only people that are allowed to change can change it)

* Configuration enforcement system
	* so that you can change the stuff on the system while running
	* on Windows the Group policies are used for that
* Configuration Scanners
	* check if the configuration is being changed (by user or by enforcement system)
* Analytics

(4) Continuous Vulnerability Assessment and Remediation

It's a very low hanging fruit
* Malware detection
* Vulnerability Scanner
* Patch Management
* Analytics



#####Summary

* Most companies implement _something_
* that is mostly OK, since they need to only implement the things they actually need
* Gives you guidance what shouldn't be forgotten

* criticism
	* There are people that say that this list has been compiled by people that are in management
	* kind of a "shopping list" (not really anymore, now they have alternatives)
	* Licensing issues:
		*it's created by a community but has a Creative Common license
	* The controls don't have a method of measuring


###Measuring success of your controls

It's really hard to measure the success of controls in huge systems. What is even the unit we need to use?

A very much incomplete list of factors that influence the security:

* People (employees and other people with access)
* Physical security
* Known and unknown vulnerabilities
* Controls to mitigate vulnerabilities in software and hardware
* Configuration and architecture of hard- and software

Measuring the security of an information system in an scientific and holistic way is (most likely) not possible

=> now what?

######Examples how to measure the security

* Security audit: a systematic evaluation measuring how well (parts) of your system conforms to a set of established criteria

* Risk Assessment: Measure the risk
	* Risk = Likelihood x Impact
	* Risk = Threat x Vulnerabilities x Impact
	* Problem: what are the units? You simply can't put the numbers

* Penetration testing

#####Is there a way out?
Probably not, we need measures to make decision, even if they are inaccurate

Reccomendations:

* Question what is measured and how and what data is used as well as the conclusions drawn from it
	* "We saw 100k failed SSH login attempts" that is twice the load of last month => increase of our exposure! => Correct?

* use relative metrics
	* "A subnet with an intrusion detectio system is more secure than one without"
	* "Applying static analysis reduces the risk"


##Conclusion for lesson

* Securing systems is hard
	* Information security management stanrads can offer guidance but rarely detailed and at a technical level
	* The CIS CSC list helps to not forget important security controls
* Measuring security is very hard
