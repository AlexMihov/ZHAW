#Lektion 4 - Intelligence gathering

* Passive: using data from third parties that is already there
	* access to information cannot be detected by the victim
	* can be quite limited and information is likely unudated
* Semi-Passive: using data gathered using legitimate behaviour
	* you behave like a normal user
	* qury only sources that are there to be queried and stick to the protocol
	* use anonymization networks or similar to hide the origin of the quries
		* that also tests their capabilities of tracking back an attack
* Active: Should be detected by the target
	* no limitations
	* most common form f information gathering
	* scanning of everything
	* is very fast in comparison to passive and semi-passive
	
##Summary

* there is not a checklist to follow
* needs to be carried out precisely and in an organized manner to be effective
* up to 90% of the time is spent on profiling the target
* Result is a unique target profile
* Most information can be sought and collected within legal boundries

##Methods and tools

* whois system
* browsing the target's website
* Google Dorking (Search Engine hacking)
* ip ranges
* scanning
* foorprinting defenses


###Whois - information on a domain

When the Domain of the target is known, the whois system can be used to get additional details

* the whois system is a distributed databasem the servers are operated by the ISPs for their respective ressources
* there are various possibilities to get the information
* you can find out for example who is responsible for the system -> that is an important person
* very easy to use and it's invisible

###Browsing the target's website

* the company website itself can provide lots of interesting information -> search function
* Phone numbers, pictures, adresses
* if you are searching for information on old data, use caches of search engines

###Search engine hacking

* use a search engine to reveal information that companies/individuals likely intended not to be discoverable trough a web search
	* account usernames and password, customer and partner lists and details etc,
* using clever search queries to get to sensitive information

#####Example
```
	inurl:wp-content inurl:zhaw.ch
	```
	
checks if the website runs any wordpress installations

* **Google Hacking Database**: a source for new and old search strings to search for this fromdifferent categories

###Scanning

Based on prvious results the target company's network and hosts are examned in more detail during scanning

* determine the network structure, especialy when analysing larger environments
* Find hosts that are reachable
* analyse the hosts in detail (OS etc)
* perform vulnerability scans

##Summary

* Scanning servers to analyse the network structure and individual hosts
* after scanning we know parts of the networks and hosts that are reachable
*
